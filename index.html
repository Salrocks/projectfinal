In the world we live in today, there are many forms of entertainment, but the one most people use is the television. While it's a way of cutting time it’s also affecting our society. The reason being many films today follow/try to satisfy the male gaze. Before we go in dept, we must understand what the male gaze. As Laura <a href = "https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/1021/Laura%2520Mulvey,%2520Visual%2520Pleasure.pdf"target="_blank">Mulvay</a> states, " The cinema satisfies a primordial wish for pleasurable looking, but it also goes further, developing scopophilia in its narcissistic aspect…the male figure cannot bear the burden of sexual objectification. " In other words, since the male gender cannot stand being objectified, the female gender then becomes victim of it, but in what ways?

Majority of movies objectifies females by portraying them as sex dolls or props for male actors to use. Essentially by doing so, the male gaze is satisfied because it wants the female to be the passive actor while the male remains dominant. The male gaze describes a way of portraying and looking at women that empowers men while sexualizing and diminishing women, but the male gaze twists this natural urge, turning women into passive items to possess and use as props.  If not all, but most of the movies addresses females as the chaser of men. They either use sexy clothes, mesmerizing tone or even their body to gain a male attention. As a matter of fact, female’s actor are more likely to be naked in a movie than male figures. " Female leaders were more than four times as likely “to be shown wearing revealing clothing” — 30% of them, versus only 7% of male leaders in the movies" as the Plan International and the Geena Davis Institute on Gender <a href ="https://www.deseret.com/2017/11/22/20636387/ignored-or-sexualized-how-hollywood-is-failing-women"  target="_blank">reported</a> To add, because of the male gaze, majority of the time woman are seen wearing revealing clothes. It could either be short skirts, heels, crop tops, etc. All this together gives satisfaction to the viewers which in this case, is the male gaze. Essentially the male gaze dictates the entire presence of a female in a film.

The truth is these are just some examples of movies that portray women like this. The effect of this is enormous. As we consume television daily, the ideas and themes we see starts to affect the way we think and act and because of that, majority of society starts to objectify female. If a woman isn’t sex compatible, or in need of a man, society sees her as an outcaste. On the other hand, if she is submissive and always satisfy the man before herself, she is seen as valuable. The sad reality is that this thinking comes from the idea of the male gaze. Not only does it devalue women it also put a label on them. The male gaze has hindered many females from rising and becoming more independent. The lack of female leaders at the top of the media industry also plays a role in this. After reaching new highs in 2020, the percentage of women directing top-grossing films declined in 2021, according to the Celluloid Ceiling Report from San Diego State <a href= " https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2022/01/03/fewer-female-directors-on-top-grossing-films-in-2021/?sh=38331a6363b1" target="_blank"> University.</a> All this together, give way for females to be seen in movies as sex toys while their counterpart is seen as a hero.
